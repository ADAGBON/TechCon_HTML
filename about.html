            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon was founded in 2015 by a group of passionate technologists who recognized 
                the need for a platform where industry leaders, innovators, and enthusiasts could 
                come together to share knowledge and shape the future of technology. What started 
                as a small gathering of 200 attendees has grown into one of the most prestigious 
                technology conferences in the world, attracting over 10,000 participants annually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the years, TechCon has evolved to reflect the rapid changes in the tech 
                landscape. From the early days focusing on web development and cloud infrastructure, 
                we've expanded to cover artificial intelligence, machine learning, cybersecurity, 
                blockchain, quantum computing, and sustainable technology solutions. Each year, 
                we've pushed boundaries and set new standards for what a technology conference 
                can achieve.
